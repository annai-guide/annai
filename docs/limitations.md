# Known limitations and deferrals

Each entry here was approved by the user. Reviewers read this file first and don't raise these again. Anything not listed here is still an open finding.

### A loud, jumping room sends one noise turn as a voice session opens
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** in a loud room whose noise jumps suddenly (about -45 to -40 dBFS, with steps of about 4 dB), about 1.5 s of room sound goes to the live model as a turn, 1.1 to 1.5 s after the microphone opens. Shiori may answer it with nothing. If Koe was about to say a reminder, it can be cut: in probes, 4 of 36 cases, against 2 of 36 before this change. The version before this change sends its own false turn in those rooms anyway, about 2 s later. In traffic, the first false turn is 0.9 s longer than before.
- **Why:** the detector learns the room only once it has heard it. A short word said the instant a new microphone stops giving zeros must be heard (the user asked for that), so sound over a guessed floor is held, and after a second it is judged against the room. A room that jumps looks like speech at that point. Three cheaper variants didn't fix it, and two of them lost the short words again.
- **Measured:** 2 of 27 synthetic changing rooms (`probe-live2` in the detector-floor review); the other 25 behave exactly as before.
- **Revisit when:** a phone test (device-checklist-phase2 L6, the car and loud-room step) shows it, or the detector is redesigned.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-23, the user: "Accept".

### A microphone that dips below -90 dB without exact zeros
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** with a microphone that dips its signal below -90 dBFS without giving exact zeros, for about 60 ms every half second, in a room of about -50 dBFS or louder, annai sends back-to-back 15-second noise turns while the microphone is open, and a sentence said inside them is swallowed.
- **Why:** such dips make a young floor a guess, and the first dipped frame (filter ringing, about -66 dB) counts as the room. No device is known to do this. The iPhone trace's gate gives exact zeros, which are handled, and the version before this change breaks the same way with such a gate from the start. A proper fix, treating a frame far under the run's own frames as a gate, is not cheap.
- **Revisit when:** a phone trace shows a device that gates this way.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-23, the user: "Accept".

### A non-English value quoted in a developer's English is read in an English voice
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** with a screen reader on Japanese or Chinese screens, a developer's English error (a broken plugin's manifest, skill or package check; a Simulate itinerary error) is read in an English voice. A non-English value it quotes, such as a manifest's `"language": "日本語"`, a Japanese stop name in an itinerary, or a zip entry's name, is read in that English voice too. Before the errors were marked, the whole sentence was read in a Japanese voice.
- **Why:** the mark covers annai's English sentence as a whole. Marking each quoted value with its own language needs every error that quotes a value to carry it as a separate part, which is more moving parts for a rare case on a developer's message.
- **Revisit when:** a screen-reader user reports it.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-27, the user: "Accept as known limitation".

### A page on an older annai refuses plugins that need plugin API 2 until it restarts
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** a page still running release 7f0dc027 or older, before it restarts into the new annai, can't add or update the official plugins that say `api: 2`: OpenRouter, Custom provider, Gemini, the four backup kinds, the three search providers and Remote trace. Tapping Update says "was made for plugin API 2; this version of annai supports API 1", keeps the version it has, and offers it again at the next check. Other updates apply, nothing retries on its own, and a restart into the new annai fixes it.
- **Why:** these plugins use `annai.l10n`, which pre-L7 annai doesn't give, so an older annai has to refuse them rather than start them broken. A 7f0dc027 page has `annai.l10n` but predates API 2, and its words can't be changed now.
- **Revisit when:** a user reports being stuck, which shouldn't happen once the page restarts.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-27, the user: "Accept as known limitation".

### A skill on a site that hides its 404s can't be installed if its SKILL.md links to a missing file
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** installing a skill from an address whose SKILL.md links to a file that isn't there, on a site that sends its browser-access (CORS) header only on success (nginx `add_header` without `always`), fails with "annai couldn't read <file> from <site>, a file its SKILL.md names…". An installed skill from such a site fails its update check the same way.
- **Why:** a linked file is left out only when the site answers that it isn't there (404, 410, or 403). No answer fails the install, so a network blip can't silently drop a file and then offer the skill as changed. A site that hides its 404s looks like no answer. GitHub raw, GitHub Pages, jsDelivr and Hugging Face send the header on 404s, and are fine.
- **Revisit when:** a user meets it on a site they can't change.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-27, the user: "Accept as known limitation".

### PDF pages draws at most a PDF's first 10 pages for a model
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** when no model here reads PDFs and the PDF pages plugin shows a PDF to a model that sees photos, only its first 10 pages go, at 1600 px on the longest side. The model is told how many were left out ("pages 1–10 of 23; the rest weren't sent"), so Shiori can say so. A model that reads PDFs itself still gets the whole file.
- **Why:** each page is a picture of about 1,600 tokens, and a booking's facts are on its first pages. More pages would cost more and take longer on the phone, for pages a booking rarely needs.
- **Revisit when:** a booking needs more than its first 10 pages.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-28, the user: "Accept".

### JPEG 2000 and JBIG2 pictures in a PDF may come out blank in PDF pages
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** a picture inside a PDF that is stored as JPEG 2000 or JBIG2 (some scanned documents) may be left blank on the page PDF pages draws. The page's text still draws.
- **Why:** PDF.js imports the decoders for those two formats from inside its worker. Where the worker's own requests don't reach annai's service worker, which serves the installed plugin's files, the decoders can't load (docs/deps.md).
- **Revisit when:** a booking PDF the user gets shows it.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-28, the user: "Accept".

### PDF pages is untested on iOS 16.4 to 17.3
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** nothing known. PDF.js 6 is built for Safari 17.4 and later; on older iPhones annai adds the one missing piece we found (`Promise.withResolvers`) and runs PDF.js on the page. Where PDF.js still can't run, the plugin says so in words ("This browser can't run PDF.js…") instead of crashing, and Safari's own first-page preview of a PDF still works.
- **Why:** there is no iOS 16.4–17.3 device or engine to test on.
- **Revisit when:** someone on an older iPhone reports it.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-28, the user: "Accept".

### Claude stops getting its earlier thinking for the rest of a turn after a rare mid-turn change
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** nothing on screen. A few rare things change part of a request after Claude has thought about it: a photo past the model's photo limit (the oldest becomes a stub), a refused photo replaced by a smaller copy, a heard line whose words are written down after it was sent, or Koe's window moving on in the middle of its turn. Claude would refuse its earlier thinking then, so annai sends none for the rest of that turn, and Claude plans each remaining step from what it can see, as it did before. The Trace counts it on the request.
- **Why:** making each of these append-only too means more code in several places, for something that happens a few times a trip at most.
- **Revisit when:** the Trace shows thinking stopped this way often.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-29, the user: "Accept (Recommended)".

### A very long turn stops carrying Claude's thinking once it has sent about 360 KB of it
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** nothing on screen. Once a turn's requests have carried 360 KB of Claude's earlier thinking in all (as in a long voice exchange with Shiori as one half), annai stops sending it for the rest of that turn, and Claude plans each remaining step from what it can see, as before. That is about 24 steps of light thinking (1.3 KB a step) or 12 of heavy (5 KB).
- **Why:** each step's request carries all the turn's earlier thinking, so the upload grows with the square of the steps: at 1.3 KB a step (measured in the real check, 2026-10-30), a 50-step turn would add about 1.6 MB. Counting what the turn has sent, not what one request carries, keeps the extra near 360 KB whatever size the steps are.
- **Revisit when:** the Trace shows long turns stopping their thinking often, or long turns lose quality the user notices.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-29, the user: "Stop past 64 KB (Recommended)". The question said the figure would be set again from the real check's measurements, to keep a turn's extra upload near 360 KB. 2026-10-30, the user: "Limit the upload (Recommended)": the limit counts the turn's extra upload itself, 360 KB, whatever size Claude's steps are.

### A repeated note can be said twice in live voice
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** with Koe on a live (realtime) model, if Kokoro sends a second note that repeats the first while Koe is already speaking, Koe may say it twice.
- **Why:** live audio can't be cut and rerun the way a typed call can (Classic Koe's call is cut and rerun with both notes). The only guard in live voice is Koe's instruction to skip a note she has already said, which a weak model can ignore.
- **Revisit when:** it happens on the user's phone with a live model.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-28, the user: "Accept as known limitation".

### A page on the old annai deletes official plugins' translations if it applies their updates before restarting
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** once, at the release that moved official plugins' translations out of their packages. A phone still running the old annai sees the plugins' new versions before it restarts. If the user taps Update before Restart, the old code installs each new package and deletes the translation it doesn't contain. Those plugins show English for the rest of that session. After the restart, the first plugin check downloads their words again (a few KB).
- **Why:** the old code already on phones can't change. Releasing the new code first and moving the translations a release later would cost every user two update rounds instead of one.
- **Revisit when:** never needed; it heals by itself at the next restart plus one check.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-28, the user: "Accept as known limitation".

### A photo brought back after the photo limit dropped it makes the provider's prompt cache miss once
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** nothing on screen. A model takes at most so many pictures per request (often 100; fewer after a provider refuses for count). In a conversation holding more photos than that, the oldest are left out with a stub. When Shiori re-reads one of them, or the user sends it again, it goes back where it first appeared. The request then changes from that early message, so that one turn pays full input price and processing time for the conversation before it. Nothing is lost or wrong.
- **Why:** avoiding it needs annai to remember what each previous request sent, per model: more moving parts for a rare, one-turn cost.
- **Revisit when:** long trips with many photos get slow or expensive after a re-read.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-28, the user: "Accept as known limitation".

### A booking's PDF shows a blank frame on Linux WebKit browsers
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** on a Linux browser built on WebKit (GNOME Web, and Playwright's WebKit), Open the original shows an empty frame where the PDF should be. Open and Download sit under it, and Download always gives the file. Chrome draws the PDF in the frame, and Safari on iPhone and Mac uses Apple's own viewer.
- **Why:** these browsers' PDF viewer is PDF.js running as a small page with inline script and style. A PDF shown from an object URL takes annai's security policy, which refuses inline script, so the viewer never starts. Serving the PDF from annai's offline worker under a looser policy would fix it, at the cost of one more moving part for very few users.
- **Revisit when:** an iPhone or Mac shows the frame blank too, or someone on GNOME Web asks.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-29, the user: "Known limitation (Recommended)".

### A Share without places can still name a place written in an unusual way
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** a Share with "Include where photos were taken and where you went" off carries nothing annai sensed (no GPS points, arrivals, conversation, watch files or photo places), and removes positions from the trip's text files (notes, memory, the recap; .md, .txt, .csv, .html) in every form annai itself writes (its position note, its maps links and its Wikipedia search) and in labelled, "near" and degree forms. Place names stay: the recap and notes still say where you went by name. A position written by hand in a rarer form can stay: degrees-minutes-seconds, a hemisphere before the number ("N 47.6, W 122.3"), two numbers with only a space between, a bare pair with two decimals, a pair split over two lines, a label inside quotes (`"lat": 47.6`, `data-lat="47.6"`), a position inside a JSON or calendar file Shiori wrote, any text file saved as UTF-16, a degree sign written in a Japanese or Chinese encoding other than UTF-8, or a position written straight after one of the rare four-byte characters of GB18030. It also removes some things that aren't positions: number pairs such as "near 12.50, 14.00 euros" or a European list "1.250, 3.500", and, in a Shift-JIS file, a half-width ｰ written right after a removed position.
- **Why:** free text has endless ways to write a position; a scrubber that caught all of them would also remove ordinary numbers.
- **Revisit when:** Shiori's place tools take "here" instead of numbers, so she never sees exact coordinates (fixing it at the source), or the user meets a form that slipped through.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-01, the user: "Common forms + limitation (Recommended)"; this exact wording, after the reviews: "Keep the wording (Recommended)".

### A deleted file that matches only an older version of another can't be deleted for good
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** Delete for good frees a deleted file together with its exact deleted copies. When a deleted file matches only an older version of another deleted file (a duplicate, then an updated file saved under the same name, all deleted), neither shows Delete for good: both stay under Deleted, restorable, until the trip is removed, which frees them.
- **Why:** freeing one would remove part of the other's history, which the user can still restore; telling the two apart safely needs more logic for a rare case.
- **Revisit when:** the user meets it.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-01, the user: "Yes, a limitation (Recommended)".

### Adding a flight leg to a booking saved before 2026-11-03 can split its legs
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** a flight booking Shiori saved before this update may keep its legs under an old top-level `flights` list. If she later appends a leg to it ("add the connecting flight"), the new leg goes under the booking's extra fields and the old ones stay where they were: the Plan keeps the flight's start, but its arrival may not move to the new last leg. Bookings saved from now on are not affected.
- **Why:** annai renames only what a save gives and never rewrites what is stored; moving old legs on an append would add a special case for old records only.
- **Revisit when:** the user meets it. Asking Shiori to rewrite the booking fixes it.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-03, the user: "Known limitation (Recommended)".

### Telling who is talking
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** annai can tell a voice near the phone from music further away by how loud it is, but not one person from another. A passenger talking near the phone is treated as the user's speech, until Shiori's own judgement says otherwise.
- **Why:** telling voices apart would likely need a voice model downloaded to the phone, estimated at several MB and not researched, in an app that ships under 3 MB. The level check comes first, and may be enough.
- **Revisit when:** a drive shows the level check and the gate aren't enough, or the user asks.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-04, the user picked "Music check now, who later (Recommended)".

### A long slow traffic jam turns voice off
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** in a jam that never gets above about 7 mph, annai can't tell a crawl from a parked car. Voice goes off about 3 minutes in and comes back about 35 seconds after traffic clears. A tap on Shiori still talks, but a reminder meanwhile may arrive silently, and "moving fast starts" can fire again when it clears. Stop-and-go that reaches 7 mph isn't affected.
- **Why:** telling a crawl from walking away from a parked car needs more logic, and GPS speed alone can't always do it; holding voice longer would leave it on after really parking.
- **Revisit when:** it bothers the user on a commute; the drive log shows how often it happens.
- **With Voice set to On:** the jam also saves the setting as off, as a drive's end does, and the chip shows "Voice on · driving" when traffic clears.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user picked "Accept it for now (Recommended)".; the wider effect: 2026-11-05, the user ticked "Jam also saves Voice off".

### AirPods taken out with no mic open go unnoticed
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** voice turns itself off when a device disconnects only if the microphone is open on that device. Otherwise iOS may move her sound to the speaker with voice still on.
- **Why:** counting every device in the list gave false alarms, such as the phone's Receiver coming and going with the mic, or a watch going out of range.
- **Revisit when:** it happens to the user, or a device check shows what iOS reports.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user ticked "AirPods with no mic open".

### A refused mic with Live on says "Voice on" for a moment
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** with Voice off and Live on, a tap whose mic is refused shows a card that explains, but the chip says "Voice on" for up to 30 s until the session's quiet spell closes it. It fixes itself.
- **Why:** the hold lasts as long as the session does, and the card already says what happened.
- **Revisit when:** it confuses someone.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user ticked "Mic refused, Live on".

### A restored backup can fire a distance reminder once
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** restoring a backup onto a phone that has driven further can make a distance reminder that hasn't fired yet fire once on open, with too large a number. A reminder that already fired stays fired.
- **Why:** telling the two phones apart needs a device id on each reading. The user: "importing with an untriggered one may cause the reminder to trigger and that can be intentional so let it be I think."
- **Revisit when:** the user meets it.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user ticked "Restored backup, distance reminder", with that note.

### Detailed trace: gaps in what it keeps
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** clips wait in memory, so a reload or kill loses up to 16 MB waiting during no signal. A turn during a 3 s sample leaves a hole in that sample.
- **Why:** saving clips would store voices on the phone, and a hole in a sample doesn't harm tuning.
- **Revisit when:** clips are lost like this on a real drive.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user ticked "Heavier trace: gaps".

### Detailed trace: text in a box with its own scroll
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** with Detailed trace on, a screen copy also includes lines hidden inside a box that scrolls by itself, and text clipped by CSS. A sweep of 14 screens, with no trip data, found no private text in such boxes.
- **Why:** telling clipped text from visible text needs more logic for something off by default.
- **Revisit when:** private text turns up in such a box.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user ticked "Heavier trace: scrolled-box text".

### A rare wrong "moving fast starts" after annai is killed
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** after annai is killed on the road, stopping at a light and driving off 3 to 5 minutes later can fire one extra reminder, and so can a stop of over 60 s at the first reading after reopening, when annai takes that stop for the real one. Carrying on in someone else's car or on a flight can skip one.
- **Why:** with no fix while it was closed, annai can't tell these apart from the way speed alone.
- **Revisit when:** the drive log shows it happening.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user ticked "Rare wrong \"moving fast starts\"". The stop of over 60 s: 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept, widen it (Recommended)".

### GPS that dies on the road reads as a stop
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** with GPS dead and annai open, moving fast holds for 5.5 minutes, then ends. Parked in a garage, a "when I stop" reminder comes on time. Still on the road with dead GPS, it's one false stop, and voice comes back at the next good reading.
- **Why:** silence can't tell a garage from a tunnel. Holding longer makes every true stop with no signal late; this is also the simpler code.
- **Revisit when:** a drive trace shows a false stop from dead GPS that the user minded.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user picked "Fire at 5.5 minutes (Recommended)".

### A stop right after reopening can fire "stops" early
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** annai was closed on the road and reopened on the road. A stop of over a minute right after that, such as a long light, can fire a one-time "when I stop" reminder, and voice is off at that point, so the reminder is shown, not spoken.
- **Why:** after a gap, annai fires the late "stops" once the first readings confirm a stop, so that a reminder missed by a closed app isn't lost. A long light reads the same as parking.
- **Revisit when:** a drive trace shows it. The user was told "a light of 30 to 60 s"; it now takes a stop of over 60 s, which is narrower than what they accepted.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user picked "Fire when you reopen (Recommended)".

### A voice-off is forgotten after a reload past the bound
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** voice turned off during a drive, then GPS gives out past the 5.5-minute bound, then the page reloads: voice-off is lost for this drive, and voice comes back on the road at the next good reading.
- **Why:** the drive has ended as far as annai can tell, and an ended drive holds no voice-off.
- **Revisit when:** it shows in a drive trace.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user accepted "Voice off forgotten".

### Voice comes back about 30 s late after a reload
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** after a reload past the bound, voice comes back about 30 s after the next good reading, not at it. "Moving fast starts" can also fire if that passes 5 minutes after the bound.
- **Why:** past the bound the drive has ended, so the road is a new start and takes the usual 30 s to settle.
- **Revisit when:** it shows in a drive trace.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user accepted "30 s late after reload".

### A false "starts" when GPS was dead over 5 minutes past the bound
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** still on the same drive, GPS dead for more than 5 minutes past the bound, then good readings: "moving fast starts" fires again, as if a new drive began.
- **Why:** over 5 minutes from the last evidence, annai can't tell the same drive from a new one.
- **Revisit when:** it shows in a drive trace.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user accepted "False "starts" after 5 min".

### A stop under a minute after a reopening reads as a light
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** the app was killed on the road, the user reopens it parked somewhere else and drives off within a minute, at about 2 to 14 km past the last reading an hour later. annai reads it all as one drive: no late "stops", no "starts", and a one-time "when I stop" reminder stays armed.
- **Why:** a stop under a minute looks exactly like a light. Reading it as a stop brings back a false "stops" and drive end at a 30 s light after a kill.
- **Revisit when:** it shows in a drive trace.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### A long lock reads as a stop at the unlock
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** the phone is locked for 5 minutes or more on a drive, then the user parks and unlocks it. annai treats the unlock as the moment they stopped: moving fast shows for 60 more seconds, voice stays on about 3 minutes, and driving off within 5 minutes gets no new "starts".
- **Why:** that's what a stop with the app on screen does, timed from the unlock. Dating it from before the lock fires a false drive end at a light after a lock.
- **Revisit when:** it bothers the user on a drive. Keeping when the wait ends separate from when the drive ended might do it; not tried.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### A light then readings with no speed can fire a false "stops"
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** on a drive with the app open, a light of about 37 to 44 s followed by a few GPS readings with no speed, while moving again, can fire one false "stops", and spend a one-time "when I stop" reminder early. About 1 in several hundred simulated city drives.
- **Why:** fixing it means more logic in the rule that has been hardest to get right, for a rare case that d1e93771 has too.
- **Revisit when:** it shows in a drive trace.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### Parking within 30 s of reopening says nothing
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** the app is killed on a drive and reopened while still moving on a stretch that looks slow in a straight line, then the user parks within 30 s. The real stop says nothing, and a one-time "when I stop" reminder waits until the end of the next drive.
- **Why:** in those 30 s annai can't tell a pull-in from a light, and reading it as a stop would likely fire a false "stops" at a light right after reopening.
- **Revisit when:** it shows in a drive trace.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### The sleep note's "let go" path has no test
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** nothing today. If that line broke, a dismissed verdict would lose Kokoro's sleep note, and where a held microphone run keeps the session open, music would keep a live session open and billing.
- **Why:** the path needs a verdict that lands with nothing going and nothing due while the detector's held run stops the quiet close. On every route tried the session closes in the same tick, so the right code and a mutant behave the same, and a click 0.1 to 0.5 s after the last turn didn't hold it open. The line's comment says what it must do.
- **Revisit when:** the sleep note's code next changes, or the test kit can hold `input.hearing` itself.

### Voice off can carry into the next drive
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** voice is turned off on a drive, the drive ends silently, the page reloads within 30 seconds, and then no GPS reading comes for over 5 minutes with the page on screen, or annai is reopened several times under 5 minutes apart with no reading. On the next drive voice stays off until that drive's stop or a tap.
- **Why:** closing it needs a quiet timer that could read a tunnel as a stop, or a new stored field. It fails quiet, not loud.
- **Revisit when:** it shows in a drive trace.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### GPS noise right after a parked reopening reads as moving
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** in the first minute after reopening annai while parked, about 30 m or more of GPS noise across a quick app switch reads as the phone having moved. A true "moving fast starts" is lost, and a reminder set at the reopening fires while parked. A small step back from d1e93771.
- **Why:** the readings alone can't tell noise from real movement across a gap, and a stricter rule would trade this for late or missed stops.
- **Revisit when:** it shows in a drive trace.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### A "when I stop" set just after reopening can fire one stop late
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** a "when I stop" set in the first minute after reopening fires at the next real stop, not this one, if the car crawls with only 3 to 5 m/s readings, or loops back and parks within 0.5 m/s of the light it left. The reminder isn't used up. No worse than d1e93771.
- **Why:** a rule that catches a crawl risks false stops at lights.
- **Revisit when:** it shows in a drive trace.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### A false drive end at a light after a reload, with voice off
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** voice is off, a drive ends silently, then a light of 35 seconds or more, a reload of 200 seconds or more, and the first readings back are that light: annai tells a drive end while still on the road. About 1 in 2100 gaps in the fuzz test. Voice ends the same way as on d1e93771, and the saved voice mode doesn't change: a told end writes it only from `on`, and turning voice off has already written `off`.
- **Why:** those readings look the same as a real stop behind a gap.
- **Revisit when:** it shows in a drive trace.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Check it, then accept (Recommended)"; checked by reading `#driveEnded` in src/core/voice/voice.js.

### A turn stops when another conversation is tapped
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** tapping another conversation (a row on the timeline, or +) while Kokoro works stops her turn there until the user comes back to it.
- **Why:** conversations don't run side by side, and `open` stops a turn.
- **Revisit when:** drives show it.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user picked "Stop until you come back (Recommended)".

### Only the trip in play reminds
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** with two trips happening at once, the other's itinerary and location reminders wait until the user talks in it, and anything whose moment passes meanwhile doesn't come later. Opening it isn't enough. Time watches fire for both, and copies already at the relay still push. A stop changed meanwhile loses its copy, and has no reminder until they talk in that trip.
- **Why:** one plan is followed at a time.
- **Revisit when:** someone misses one.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-05, the user picked "Only the one in play (Recommended)". The wider wording: 2026-11-06, the user picked "Yes, widen it (Recommended)". Until they talk in it, not until it's opened: 2026-11-06, the user picked "Talking moves it". A changed stop's copy goes: 2026-11-06, the user picked "Call it off (Recommended)".

### A turn cut by a failed open doesn't resume on its own
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** a conversation fails to open while Shiori is mid-turn. The turn stops, and the note says "She picks it up when you come back" though they never left. She answers with their next line, which carries both, and the microphone closes; a tap reopens it.
- **Why:** a restart there adds a wake when the store is probably failing anyway; the released copy cuts the turn the same way.
- **Revisit when:** a failed open shows up in real use.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### An answer to a reminder goes to the trip left open, and moves play there
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** two trips are happening, A is in play, and B was left open after a look. A's itinerary reminder is said, the user taps Shiori and answers. The line goes to B's conversation and moves play to B: A's itinerary and location reminders stop, and Driving shows B, until they talk in A.
- **Why:** annai can't tell an answer to A's reminder from a new line about B, and a timing rule for it would go into the hardest logic here.
- **Revisit when:** a user reports it, or overlapping trips get common.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### The language changes while a reminder waits at the relay for a trip not in play
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** two trips are happening, one is in play, and the other's reminder already waits at the relay. The screens' language changes. The reminder arrives in the old language, or mixed ("a leave soon" in the old one, a "coming up" with the old words and the minutes left in the new).
- **Why:** changing it means calling a good reminder off, or a trip not in play sending.
- **Revisit when:** anyone reports it.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### The trip is renamed while a reminder waits at the relay for it, and it is not in play
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** the notification's title shows the old trip name. The stop's words are right.
- **Why:** calling them off would lose every waiting reminder of that trip over a name.
- **Revisit when:** anyone reports it.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### A stop is added before a "leave soon" stop while its trip waits at the relay, not in play
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** the "leave soon" reminder keeps its old time and can come late. Its words are right. Talking in that trip corrects it.
- **Why:** a leave time is an estimate, a waiting reminder doesn't follow the GPS either, and calling it off loses a reminder for a stop nobody touched.
- **Revisit when:** anyone reports it.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### `item.says ??= hash` in the push mirror can go
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** nothing. A copy sent before copies carried `says` takes the plan's digest at its first sync, once; the line that does it stays in the code.
- **Why:** a copy waits at the relay 29 days at most, so after 30 days from the release that added `says` no such copy is left.
- **Revisit when:** 30 days after this release ships: remove the line in `#wanted` and its adoption tests.

### An edit or a new reminder can miss the relay if annai closes right after a failed read
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** reads are failing, and annai is closed before the retry. An edit to a stop in any trip, the one in play too, can leave its old words at the relay, and they can arrive until annai next opens. A reminder just set may not reach the relay at all, so it doesn't arrive while annai is closed. One failed read of any trip stops the whole sync, which is why the trip in play and a new reminder are caught too. A locked phone may count as closed; that is traced in the code, not tried on a phone.
- **Why:** nothing runs while annai is closed, and calling off on doubt would lose good reminders to one failed read. It corrects itself when annai next opens.
- **Revisit when:** the Trace shows reads failing (an `error` entry of kind `read` in the device's log, under the Errors kind).
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)", for an edit in a trip that isn't in play. Widened: 2026-11-06, the user picked "Yes, widen it (Recommended)": it covers the trip in play too. Then, 2026-11-06, the user picked "Yes, widen it (Recommended)", told: "With reads failing and annai then closed, an edit in any trip can leave old words at the relay, and a reminder you've just set may not reach the relay at all, so it wouldn't arrive while annai is closed. A locked phone may count as closed; that's traced in the code, not tried on a phone."

### A stop deleted or changed just before reads fail can be said once from the old plan
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** a stop is deleted, or moved or changed, the reload and its retry both fail, and the stop's old moment comes while reads are still failing: its reminder is said once, at the old time and in the old words. It stops once reads work.
- **Why:** while reads are failing annai keeps the plan it has. Pausing the plan while behind would hold back every good reminder during any failure.
- **Revisit when:** the Trace shows it (an `error` entry of kind `read` in the device's log).
- **Approved:** 2026-11-06, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)", for a deleted stop. Widened: 2026-11-06, the user picked "Yes, widen it (Recommended)": a stop moved or changed, with its reload and retry failing, is said once at the old time, in the old words, if reads are still failing then.

### Live starts with GPS off when its settings can't be read at start
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** the phone's storage fails to read annai's settings at the moment Live starts, past the store's own retry: Live starts with GPS off for that page load, even if it was on, and runs as it does with GPS off. A reload, or turning GPS on, brings it back. Nothing writes the "off" back: the saved setting stays as it was.
- **Why:** a failed read says nothing of the setting. Before, the same failure left no Live at all for that page load; starting with GPS off keeps everything else running.
- **Revisit when:** the Trace shows it (an `error` entry of kind `read` in the device's log), or the user meets it.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-07, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### A failed Trace line can wait forever after a fast simulation
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** only in a "fast" simulation: a read fails past the retry, the Trace line's own write fails too, and the run ends. The line is never written, because its retry waits on the simulation's clock, which nothing advances after the run.
- **Why:** it needs a simulation and two failures at once, and the line is developer-facing.
- **Revisit when:** the next change to Live's Trace lines: set the retry on `this.#sim?.clock ?? this.clock`.

### Back shows Trips once more when a trip removed elsewhere had only Trips before it
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** annai opened on Trips, the user opened a trip, then came back to Trips, and the trip was removed somewhere other than its own screen (in a second annai tab, for example). Back on Trips passes the trip's entries and shows Trips once more, in place; the next Back leaves annai.
- **Why:** the first entry is Trips, and a page can't close itself or step back past its first entry, so the last Back has to land on something.
- **Revisit when:** browsers let a page leave its own first entry, or a user reports it.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-07, the user picked "Accept for now (Recommended)".

### A chat whose first sentence ends on a one- or two-letter word is named with the next sentence too
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** a chat is named from its first line's first sentence. A full stop after a word of one or two letters (Mt., St., Dr.) doesn't end it, so "Mt. Fuji on Tuesday. Then lunch" is named "Mt. Fuji on Tuesday." The cost: a first sentence that really ends on a short word ("We land in LA. Then…") runs on into the next one, and the name is cut at 40 characters as long names are. A word of three letters (Mrs.), and `?`, `!`, `。` and a new line, still end it. The user can rename the chat.
- **Why:** the browser's sentence breaker has no list of English abbreviations (it breaks after "Mt."), and a list of our own would need every language's abbreviations. The rule is one line in `chats.js`.
- **Revisit when:** a user finds a name that reads worse than before.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-08, the user chose "English rule" (a full stop after a word of one or two letters doesn't end the sentence).

### With a keyboard up, a field on home can sit under the stuck box
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** not verified on a phone. A field of Start a trip focused on home (by a keyboard's Tab, or a screen reader) is scrolled clear of the top bar and the box stuck under it, its label too. But with a keyboard up (about 290 to 340 px), when the bar and a box that holds an opened card or two cards (up to half the room under the bar: 256 px at 320 x 568, 292 at 360 x 640, 302 at 393 x 659) take all the room above the keyboard, the field has nowhere to show, and the browser's own scrolling for the keyboard may put it back under the box.
- **Why:** the box is at most half the room under the bar (the user's "Cap every box at half"), not half the room above a keyboard; making it give way while a field has focus would change that design.
- **Revisit when:** stage 8, where the Start a trip form, home's only fields, goes; or the user's phone check of "Cap every box at half" finds it first.

### In landscape, an opened stack is read by scrolling inside a short box
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** on a phone turned on its side (740 x 360), Show on a stuck stack opens it in a box of about 152 px, half the room under the top bar. A card of 168 to 193 px doesn't show whole: its title and Dismiss show, and its middle scrolls under the Dismiss; while a card's top is in the lower part of the box, its own Dismiss covers its title for a moment. In portrait every card shows whole.
- **Why:** every stuck box on home is at most half the room under the bar, so the page never moves (the user's "Cap every box at half" and "Opens in place"); a short screen leaves a short box.
- **Revisit when:** the user's phone check finds it in the way, or a landscape layout for home is designed.
- **Approved:** 2026-11-09, the user chose "Known limitation".

### Details says "trip" on a chat, and Welcome and import say "the timeline" where the screen says "Trips"
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** Details of a chat says "Remove trip", "Archive trip" and "This trip so far", though a chat isn't a trip (the spec's anti-goal: no "trip" on small chats). Welcome and the import screen say "the timeline" where the screen and the top bar say "Trips".
- **Why:** both are words on screens that change shape with the Start a trip form's going, so they change once, in every language.
- **Revisit when:** stage 8.

### read_trip reads a long text file only up to its result's cut
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** Shiori reads a text file in another trip (a saved booking email, a long note) with read_trip and gets its first 40,000 characters, the limit on any tool's result (`RESULT_MAX`), told how many more were cut. She can't read on from there: an answer from the rest of the file, the end of a long email say, needs a move to that trip, where `read` has `from`.
- **Why:** read_trip's `path` gives a file whole, and the result's own cut is all that bounds it; `from` was left out of stage 5's tool (found in the build's review, finding 11).
- **Revisit when:** the next version: read_trip takes `from`, as `read` does.

### A move cut off halfway leaves the file in both trips
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** if annai is closed in the few milliseconds between the two writes of a file's move (Shiori's, or Undo's moving it back), the file is in both trips. A second Undo then moves it again: "flight.pdf" and "flight (2).pdf".
- **Why:** a move is two transactions, one per trip.
- **Revisit when:** the next version: a move is one transaction (workspace.js), for Shiori's moves and Undo's alike. That is an API change, with its lessons entry.

### A change made from home itself shows "changed since" on its card only at the next redraw
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** with home on screen, a change Shiori makes to a trip through the dock leaves its card saying "backed up 10 minutes ago" with no "changed since" until home is next drawn: when a backup ends (a few minutes later with a backup place), the next time annai comes to the front, midnight, or a Next that ends. Without a backup place, the next of the other three. Before the branch that moved "… ago" into place, the next minute's redraw showed it. Traced by the review of a379a5f7..56612b84, not run.
- **Why:** home draws again for a backup's end, each time annai comes to the front, midnight and a Next that ends, and changes the "… ago" words in place; it doesn't follow what the workspace writes.
- **Revisit when:** the next version: home follows `ws.onChange` for trips' writes, coalesced, and draws again (or changes the card's words in place).

### Turning the phone with home scrolled to its end leaves the page a little off its end
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** with home scrolled to its very end (Start a trip's form, Open a file, the last backup line), turning the phone to landscape and back, or a window that gets shorter and comes back, leaves the page not quite at its end: 12 px in Chromium (45 px with a short card stuck), and in WebKit's emulation up to 285 px with an opened card. Mid-page nothing moves (0 px in 76 measured cases). Measured in the test browsers at four phone sizes (2026-11-10); a real iPhone's rotation was not looked at, and Playwright's resize is not a real rotation.
- **Why:** two causes. The 12 px is annai's own: the dock is 53 px tall in portrait and 41 px in landscape, the shell's observer sets the page's bottom padding from it a frame after the resize, and nothing scrolls the page to its new end (so it is every screen with the dock, not only home). The rest is the engine clamping the scroll against the small size's layout before the notices box is fitted again; "was at its end" can't be told at the resize event, so a fix needs it remembered across the resize's steps. A first route (scroll to the new end after the fits) fixed only Chromium's short card.
- **Revisit when:** the next version: a page read to its end stays at its end across a size change and a dock that changes height (remembered before the change, restored after the fits), after a look at a real phone's rotation.
