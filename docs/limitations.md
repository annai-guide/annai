### A loud, jumping room sends one noise turn as a voice session opens
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** in a loud room whose noise jumps suddenly (about -45 to -40 dBFS, with steps of about 4 dB), about 1.5 s of room sound goes to the live model as a turn, 1.1 to 1.5 s after the microphone opens. Shiori may answer it with nothing. If Koe was about to say a reminder, it can be cut: in probes, 4 of 36 cases, against 2 of 36 before this change. The version before this change sends its own false turn in those rooms anyway, about 2 s later. In traffic, the first false turn is 0.9 s longer than before.
- **Why:** the detector learns the room only once it has heard it. A short word said the instant a new microphone stops giving zeros must be heard (the user asked for that), so sound over a guessed floor is held, and after a second it is judged against the room. A room that jumps looks like speech at that point. Three cheaper variants didn't fix it, and two of them lost the short words again.
- **Measured:** 2 of 27 synthetic changing rooms (`probe-live2` in the detector-floor review); the other 25 behave exactly as before.
- **Revisit when:** a phone test (device-checklist-phase2 L6, the car and loud-room step) shows it, or the detector is redesigned.

### A microphone that dips below -90 dB without exact zeros
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** with a microphone that dips its signal below -90 dBFS without giving exact zeros, for about 60 ms every half second, in a room of about -50 dBFS or louder, annai sends back-to-back 15-second noise turns while the microphone is open, and a sentence said inside them is swallowed.
- **Why:** such dips make a young floor a guess, and the first dipped frame (filter ringing, about -66 dB) counts as the room. No device is known to do this. The iPhone trace's gate gives exact zeros, which are handled, and the version before this change breaks the same way with such a gate from the start. A proper fix, treating a frame far under the run's own frames as a gate, is not cheap.
- **Revisit when:** a phone trace shows a device that gates this way.

### Official plugin downloads carry every language's translation
- **Kind:** deferred.
- **What the user sees:** nothing on screen. Each official plugin download includes its Japanese and its Chinese translation, whatever language the screens are in. For a typical OpenRouter user's three plugins that is about 4 KB of 20 KB compressed. Across all 31 official plugins, translations are about a quarter of the bytes, and each added language adds about 12%.
- **Why:** annai verifies an official plugin by every file the catalog lists. A plugin downloaded with only the screens' language would look like a changed copy and be offered as an update forever. A language change would also need a fetch. For two languages the cost is small.
- **Revisit when:** a third language ships. Then move official plugins' translations to a per-language fetch, as `catalog/l10n/<tag>.json` already does for the catalog's own words.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-27, the user: "Defer to a 3rd language".

### A non-English value quoted in a developer's English is read in an English voice
- **Kind:** known limitation.
- **What the user sees:** with a screen reader on Japanese or Chinese screens, a developer's English error (a broken plugin's manifest, skill or package check; a Simulate itinerary error) is read in an English voice. A non-English value it quotes, such as a manifest's `"language": "日本語"`, a Japanese stop name in an itinerary, or a zip entry's name, is read in that English voice too. Before the errors were marked, the whole sentence was read in a Japanese voice.
- **Why:** the mark covers annai's English sentence as a whole. Marking each quoted value with its own language needs every error that quotes a value to carry it as a separate part, which is more moving parts for a rare case on a developer's message.
- **Revisit when:** a screen-reader user reports it.
- **Approved:** 2026-10-27, the user: "Accept as known limitation".
